Or, imagine if you were forced to re-input your username and password every time you visit your favorite social media website. Cookies solve that problem too, because they store information that helps sites identify who you are. These kinds of cookies are called first-party cookies because they are created and used by the website you visited."),(0,r.mdx)("p",null,"Third-party cookies also exist. To better understand them, let’s consider this example: "),(0,r.mdx)("p",null,'Let’s say a hypothetical social media company called "Friends" provides a Share button that other sites implement to allow Friends users to share the site’s content on the Friends feed.

The malicious site could include code that makes a request to the banking site that executes when the page loads. Because the user is still authenticated to the banking site, the session cookie can be used to launch a CSRF attack to initiate a funds transfer event out of the user’s bank account.

As your user interacts with your website, you can pass the user’s behavioral and interest data to Target through the JavaScript library.
