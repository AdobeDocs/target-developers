# Use Location Service

Location is an important context for understanding and engaging with mobile users. By using this context, mobile app developers can enhance the app design and make it a more personalized and engaging experience.

Adobe Experience Platform Location Service (Location Service) is a geo-location service that enables mobile apps with location awareness to understand the location context by using rich and easy-to-use SDK interfaces accompanied by a flexible database of points of interests (POIs).

You can use Location Service with Target to leverage rules with [tags in Adobe Experience Platform](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/tags/home.html) to attach your Places data to your Adobe Target SDK events.

For more information, see [Use Location Service with Adobe Target](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/places/using/use-places-with-other-solutions/places-target/places-target.html) in the [Adobe Experience Platform Location Service guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/places/using/home.html).
