# Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK

Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK (AEP Web SDK) is a client-side JavaScript library that allows customers of Adobe Experience Cloud to interact with the various services in the Experience Cloud (including Target) through the Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network. In addition to the JavaScript library, there is an Adobe Experience Platform extension to help with your Web SDK configurations.
