# Hybrid implementation

Adobe Target offers a unique hybrid deployment model for personalizationâ€”blending client-side and server-side implementations. This hybrid model allows non-technical users to author an experiment or personalization activity using the WYSIWYG Visual Experience Composer (VEC) and have the experience be executed, delivered, and rendered by the server-side for a highly performant delivery.
