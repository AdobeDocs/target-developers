# SDKs

Adobe Target offers SDKs to interact with the Target Delivery API and help ease the Adobe Target integration with other Experience Cloud solutions such as Adobe Analytics and Adobe Audience Manager by helping you follow best practices in managing sessions and cookies. Therefore, it is highly recommended to leverage a SDK to mask away these complexities and prevent incorrect utilization of the API.
